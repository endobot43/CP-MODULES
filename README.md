# CP-MODULES

This is a compiled set of chart.js modules.

--> Chart markup starts @ line 174.  Look to the comments for style control and setting static values for display input valdation.

--> NOTE: the assets folder has been leaned out to remove as much non-essentials as possible... this includes icons.
therefore no icons will appear in the rendered view.

--> the 'assets' folder should reside at the same level as the .html document.
