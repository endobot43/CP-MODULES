# CP-MODULES

This is a compiled set of chart.js modules, chartist modules, and BS4 Components

--> the 'assets' folder should reside at the same level as the .html documents.

--> All HTML docs from this point forward will share the same assets folder --> be sure to update whenever a new html file is added to the series @ root.

--> Chart.js and Chartist markup starts @ line 174.  Look to the comments for style control and
setting static values for display input valdation.

--> NOTE: the assets folder has been leaned out to remove as much non-essentials as
possible... this includes icons. therefore no icons will appear in the rendered view.
